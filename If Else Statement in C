The "if" statement in C evaluates the test expression inside the parenthesis (),
if the test expression is evaluated to be true, the statement inside the body of "if" will be executed,
but if it is false the statement inside the body of "if" won't be executed.
The syntax of the "if" in C is; if (test expression) then you go ahead with writing your code.
The "if...else" statement in C evaluates the test expression inside the parenthesis (), 
if the test expression is true, the statement inside the body of "if" are executed and 
the statement inside the body of else are skipped from execution but if the test statement in the
"if" parenthesis is false, the statement in the "else" statement is executed and the statement in the
"if" parenthesis is skipped from execution. 
The syntax for if...else statement is if (test expression) {run code if test expression is true}
else {run code if test expression is false}
In summary, if the test expression in if is true, then is executed leaving the statement in the body of else skipped
But if the test expression in "if" is false then is skipped and the statement in "else" is executed.
The if else ladder allows you to check between multiple test expression and execute different statements.
The syntax for the if else ladder is similar to the one stated above only with a little addition.
We say, if (test expression){statements}else if(test expression2){statements}else if(test expression3){statement}...
This goes on for as long as we want and ends with else{statements}.
Nested if else is including an if else statemnt inside the body of another if else statement.
